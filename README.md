% These scripts are developed in Matlab, The Mathworks.

% The script AverageClicksOdontIVData_P24152.m computes several features of filmed porpoise phonic lip opening and closing % and signatures in acoustic recordings (hydrophone and microphone) in individual porpoises. Here the data for one individual is included except for the hydrophone and Digital Kymogram data that were >100 Mb and too large to add in GitHub.

% The script CombinePLKinetics.m computes the average upsampled Digital Kymogram (DKG) of DKG snippets alligned to hydophone click onset detections.
